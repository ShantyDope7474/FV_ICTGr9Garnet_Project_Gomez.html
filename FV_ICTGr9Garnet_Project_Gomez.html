And in the same period, 85% of fatal fires at home were started accidentally, so it makes sense to always be limiting our risks.</h3></td>

Keep your cooking area free of combustible materials. Keep anything that can catch fire, such as food packaging, oven mitts and towels, away from your stovetop.</h3></td>

Candles may be pretty to look at but they are a cause of home fires — and home fire deaths. Remember, a candle is an open flame, which means that it can easily ignite anything that can burn.</h3></td>
